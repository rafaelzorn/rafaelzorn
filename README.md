Software Developer at [Grupo Plan Marketing](https://www.planmkt.com.br/)

Hello, I'm Rafael. I have a degree in Internet Systems from [Feevale University](https://www.feevale.br/), and have been working in the field since 2013. Always curious about technology, I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and knowledge, whether through courses, training, or personal projects.

- :computer: Iâ€™m currently working with Laravel, Vue and React Native.

Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
